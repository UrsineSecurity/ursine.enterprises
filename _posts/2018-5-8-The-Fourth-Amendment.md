### "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."
*Benjamin Franklin*

It is sadly ironic to me that all the rockets I ever fired and all the bullets I ever dodged did not protect my country against the fear of the people and the govenment's willingness to exploit it.  There is not an authoritarian regime on this earth that would not have squealed with delight to be given the power that the Patriot Act provided our Executive branch.  The state of our country is what happens when the checks and balances that were put into place are strangled by the fear of being called unpatriotic.  All any tyrant needs to do in order to stay in control is convince the people they should not question the actions of the government.

[The Electronic Freedom Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) has been around since 1990 and has high level operations to help secure our electronic liberty, but there are steps that we can take as well.  Whether one is an individual, a family member, or the member of an organization, there are attack vectors inherant in living in a technilogical society such as ours.  Unless one wants to drop off the grid entirely, one will leave a footprint on the internet.  We need to protect ourselves not only from the prying eyes of the government but also from the nefarious encroachment of hackers.

Many security experts of today were the hackers of the past.  Kevin Mitnick is considered the world's most famous hacker who now runs [Mitnick Security](https://mitnicksecurity.com/).  Hacking, in and of itself, is not evil.  It is just a tool.  It is the intention of the hacker that makes it good or evil.  Many of the same tools that 'black hat' hackers use are used by 'white hat' hackers in performing penetration testing and bug bounty hunting.  It is a permanent rivalry, and we all have skin in the game.  You don't have to be a master hacker to take steps to protect your information and your privacy.  In the upcoming posts I am going to introduce simple procedures that anyone can follow that will make you a harder target for black hat hackers and incompetent corporations.
