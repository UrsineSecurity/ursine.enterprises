# About me

I am a retired field artilleryman.  My military experience included additional duties as the Security NCO, Key Control NCO, and Document Custodian.  

I swore to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  My oath is, and always will be, in effect, though I no longer have orders to obey.  I think that the Fourth Amendment is in far more danger than the Second.  The ability of corporations and governments to capture and store our most private information without our permission will never be a good thing for many reasons, not least of which is their inability to protect the information.

Since the turn of the century my information has been compromised at least once a year.  Sometimes the data is relatively meaningless and easy to change.  Other times it is not.  My background investigation data was stolen from the Office of Personnel Management, my medical records were stolen from SAIC, and my entire credit history, social security number, and residence history was stolen from Equifax.  This information gives strategic advantage to hackers which a free year of credit monitoring does not mitigate at all.  Each of these thefts could have been prevented by following simple procedures.  But, since I cannot control the actions of others, I must control my own.  

After I retired I went to school to become a Computer Engineer, and graduated cum laude from the University of Alabama in Huntsville in 2012.  Currently I am pursuing a Master's degree in Cybersecurity Engineering from my Alma Mater.  I use the knowledge and skills to make myself a harder target for hackers as well as make it difficult for corporations to invade my privacy.  I hope to make these skills useful to others, as well.
